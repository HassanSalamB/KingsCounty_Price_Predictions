## 1. Purpose
Our stakeholder, Mr. Charles C. is interested in investing in properties for the purpose of selling them at higher profits. However, he is not sure whether he should buy new or old houses. Or if he should consider renovating the building before he sells them. Or if he should wait for some years before selling them, perhaps the prices may go higher in near future. In this analysis, we have come up with some hypothesis to assist Mr Charles. They are mentioned below:

1. It would be in his best interest to renovate properties which have never been renevoated.
2. We will predict the prices of the houses based on their features for our stakeholder
